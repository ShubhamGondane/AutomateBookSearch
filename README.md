# AutomateBookSearch
### A script that gets your to read list from Goodreads and searches for used books on sites like Abebooks.com. The script will then send an email to your account with top 3 cheapest available books.

### Add a config file that contains your gmail username and app password that is different from your actual email password(You can get one from your google account settings) Get the API access from Goodreads and also store the key and the secret key in the same config file.

### You can automate this by creating a cron job that runs once a week.
